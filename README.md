Example Configuration
Hereâ€™s a sample configuration for defining an entry and exit location


    {
    entry = vector3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), 
    exit = vector3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    headingEnter = 0.0,
    headingExit = 0.0,
    name = "Hidden Location" 
    }



Usage
Players can interact with the defined locations using their third eye (ox_target). Upon interaction, they will smoothly enter or exit the specified location, enhancing immersion and gameplay flow.

Compatibility
This script is designed for use with the QBCore framework and ox_target. Ensure your server is running the appropriate versions of both for full compatibility. It should also work with ESX/QBX, provided you have ox_target.

Note: If you're using a different framework than QBCore, simply remove the TriggerEvent('QBCore:Notify', "You exited " .. location.name, 'success') events from client.lua and the 'qb-core' entry from fxmanifest.lua.

Support
If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the script, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository or reach out to the developer.
